package scanner

// Cataloger is a syft cataloger to enable for a scan, together with the in-image file
// paths it targets. Ecosystem is the packages directive type the cataloger serves (a
// config.PackagesDirectiveType, kept as a string so that this package does not depend
// on the configuration), Workdir the in-image directory of that directive and Manager
// the package manager executable the directive names, when it names one; the spec file (SourcePaths[0]) is
// parsed after the scan to record which cataloged packages the directive declares, and a
// Go module graph is read from the image in Workdir. Env is the directive environment,
// applied when running a command in the image. SourcePaths are required inputs (the
// spec, e.g. go.mod): a directive scan fails if any is absent from the image.
// OptionalSourcePaths are best-effort inputs (the lock, e.g. go.sum): absent ones are
// skipped, matching the previous full-image scan which simply did not catalog a file
// that was not there. Enrichment, when set, names the installed-package files the
// cataloger reads next to the lock to enrich lock-derived components with metadata the
// lock lacks (licenses); it is best-effort like the lock. SourceLang is the source
// language of the packages the cataloger finds, stamped on every component as
// GOST:source_langs; it is empty for ecosystems that install prebuilt binaries of an
// arbitrary language (os-pm), which carry their languages from the pm catalog instead.
// All are materialized under their full in-image path for a targeted directory scan.
