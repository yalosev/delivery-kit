## What are user stages?

***User stage*** is a stage containing _assembly instructions_ from the config.

Currently, there is one kind of assembly instructions: _shell_. werf provides four user stages and executes them in the following order: _beforeInstall_, _install_, _beforeSetup_, and _setup_. You can create a specific Docker layer by executing assembly instructions in the corresponding stage.

## Using user stages

werf provides four _user stages_ where assembly instructions can be defined. werf does not impose any restrictions on assembly instructions. You can specify the same variety of instructions as for the `RUN` instruction in Dockerfile. At the same time, the categorization of assembly instructions is based on our experience with real-world applications. So, the following actions are enough for building the vast majority of applications:

- installing system packages;
- installing system dependencies;
- installing application dependencies;
- setting up system applications;
- setting up an application.

What is the best strategy for carrying them out? You might think the best way is to run them one by one, caching the interim results. On the other hand, it is better not to mix instructions for these actions because of different file dependencies. The _user stages pattern_ suggests the following strategy:

- use the _beforeInstall_ user stage for installing system packages;
- use the _install_ user stage to install system and application dependencies;
- use the _beforeSetup_ user stage to configure system parameters and install an application;
- use the _setup_ user stage to configure an application.

<div class="details">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="details__summary">How the Stapel stage assembly works</a>
<div class="details__content" markdown="1">

When building a stage, the stage instructions are supposed to run in a container based on the previous built stage or [base image]({{"usage/build/stapel/base.html#from" | true_relative_url }}). We will further refer to such a container as a **build container**.

Before running the _build container_, werf prepares a set of instructions. This set depends on the stage type and contains both werf service commands and user commands specified in the `werf.yaml` config file. The service commands may include, for example, adding files, applying patches, etc.

The Stapel builder uses its own set of tools and libraries and does not depend on the base image in any way. When the _build container_ is started, werf mounts everything it needs from the special service image named `registry.werf.io/werf/stapel`.

For `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` targets, the werf binary already contains this Stapel image embedded inside it, so werf loads it directly instead of pulling it from the registry — no network access to `registry.werf.io` is required in this case, which makes it work out of the box in isolated/air-gapped environments. If you target a different platform, or override the Stapel image reference (see below), werf falls back to pulling the image from the registry as before.

If your environment cannot access this image directly, for example when working in an isolated environment or using a private registry, you can override the Stapel service image reference before running werf:

```shell
export WERF_STAPEL_IMAGE_NAME=registry.werf.io/werf/stapel
export WERF_STAPEL_IMAGE_VERSION=0.6.2
```

When using a private registry:

1. Set the `WERF_STAPEL_IMAGE_NAME` environment variable to the repository address of the Stapel image.
2. Ensure that the `${WERF_STAPEL_IMAGE_NAME}:${WERF_STAPEL_IMAGE_VERSION}` image exists in the registry.
3. Make sure werf is authenticated in the registry before the build starts.

The _build container_ [gets the socket to communicate with the SSH-agent on the host](#using-the-ssh-agent); [custom mounts]({{"usage/build/stapel/mounts.html" | true_relative_url }}) can also be used.



It is also worth noting that werf ignores some of the base image manifest parameters when building, replacing them with the following values:
- `--user=0:0`;
- `--workdir=/`;
- `--entrypoint=/.werf/stapel/embedded/bin/bash`.

So the start of the _build container_ of some arbitrary stage typically looks as follows:

```shell
docker run \
  --volume=/tmp/ssh-ln8yCMlFLZob/agent.17554:/.werf/tmp/ssh-auth-sock \
  --volumes-from=stapel_0.6.1 \
  --env=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/.werf/tmp/ssh-auth-sock \
  --user=0:0 \
  --workdir=/ \
  --entrypoint=/.werf/stapel/embedded/bin/bash \
  sha256:d6e46aa2470df1d32034c6707c8041158b652f38d2a9ae3d7ad7e7532d22ebe0 \
  -ec eval $(echo c2V0IC14 | /.werf/stapel/embedded/bin/base64 --decode)
```

</div>
</div>

### beforeInstall

```yaml
shell:
  beforeInstall:
    - apt update -q
    - apt install -y curl mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev g++ build-essential libcurl4
  beforeInstallCacheVersion: "1"
```

This stage executes various instructions before installing an application. It is best suited for system applications that rarely change. At the same time, their installation process is very time-consuming. Also, at this stage, you can configure some system parameters that rarely change, such as a locale or a timezone, add groups and users, etc. For example, you can install language distributions and build tools like PHP and Composer, Java and Gradle, and so on.

Since these components rarely change, they will be cached by the _beforeInstall_ stage for an extended period.

`beforeInstallCacheVersion: <string>` — an optional directive to invalidate the build cache of a given stage in a deterministic way based on changes introduced by the Git commit.

### install

```yaml
shell:
  install:
    - bundle install
    - npm ci
  installCacheVersion: "1"
```

This stage is best suited for installing an application and its dependencies and performing some basic configuration.

This stage has access to the application source code in Git, so you can install application dependencies using build tools (e.g., Composer, Gradle, npm, etc.) that require a manifest file (e.g., pom.xml, Gruntfile) to work. A best practice is to make this stage dependent on changes in that manifest file.

`installCacheVersion: <string>` — an optional directive to invalidate the build cache of a given stage in a deterministic way based on changes introduced by the Git commit.

### beforeSetup

```yaml
shell:
  beforeSetup:
    - rake assets:precompile
  beforeSetupCacheVersion: "1"
```

This stage allows you to prepare your application to customize some parameters. It supports all kinds of compiling tasks: creating jars, creating executable files and dynamic libraries, creating web assets, uglification, and encryption. This stage is often made dependent on changes in the source code.

`beforeSetupCacheVersion: <string>` — an optional directive to invalidate the build cache of a given stage in a deterministic way based on changes introduced by the Git commit.

### setup

```yaml
shell:
  setup:
    - npm run build
  setupCacheVersion: "1"
```

This stage deals with the application settings. A typical set of actions includes copying some profiles into `/etc`, copying configuration files to already-known locations, creating a file containing the application version. These actions should not be time-consuming since they will likely be performed on every commit.

`setupCacheVersion: <string>` — an optional directive to invalidate the build cache of a given stage in a deterministic way based on changes introduced by the Git commit.

### Custom strategy

No limitations are imposed on assembly instructions. The suggested use of _user stages_ is only a recommendation based on our experience with real-world applications. You can use just one _user stage_, or you can design your own instruction grouping strategy to take advantage of caching and dependency changes in the Git repositories tailored to how your application is built.

## Installing binary packages

The `packages` directive provides a declarative way to declare package dependencies. werf processes each entry in a dedicated `packagesInstall` stage that runs before the `install` stage. The directive does not depend on SBOM generation: packages are installed the same way whether `build.sbom.enable` is set or not. When [SBOM generation]({{ "/usage/build/sbom.html" | true_relative_url }}) is enabled (`build.sbom.enable: true`), the installed packages — including their transitive dependencies — are additionally recorded in the resulting image SBOM.

When SBOM generation is enabled, network is disabled in shell stages, so installing dependencies with commands in any shell stage (`beforeInstall`, `install`, `beforeSetup`, `setup`) is impossible — the `packages` directive becomes the only channel for installing dependencies (see [SBOM technical limitations]({{ "/usage/build/sbom.html#technical-limitations" | true_relative_url }})).

Two kinds of package sources are supported:

- **OS-level package managers**: `os-pm`;
- **Language package managers** (file-based): `go-mod`, `python-uv`, `python-pip`, `python-poetry`, `rust-cargo`, `lua-rock`, `ruby-bundler`, `ruby-gemspec`, `javascript-npm`, `javascript-yarn`, `javascript-pnpm`.

### OS packages

The `os-pm` type installs system packages via the `pm` package manager bundled in the builder base image:

```yaml
image: app
from: registry.example.com/base/ubuntu:22.04
packages:
  - type: os-pm
    spec:
      - curl==8.12.1
      - jq
```

- `type: os-pm` — selects the `pm` package manager.
- `spec` — an inline list of packages to install; a version is pinned with `==` (`curl==8.12.1`) or `@` (`curl@8.12.1`), without a version the default one is installed. This is the only format: a file with a package list instead of the inline list is not supported.
- `workdir` is not supported for `os-pm`.

The base image must provide the `pm` binary in `$PATH` — otherwise the build fails because `pm` cannot be found. The builder base images also set the `PACKAGES_VERSION` and `REGISTRY` environment variables themselves, so there is normally no need to set them manually. `PACKAGES_VERSION` is mandatory: werf stores it in the image and reports it in the SBOM as the `containerfactoryversion` qualifier, and the packages stage fails when no source provides it.

On a base image that sets neither variable — a `scratch` image with `pm` imported into it, for example — pass them through `env`, referencing a build secret when the value must not end up in the build instructions (see [Secrets in packages](#secrets-in-packages)):

```yaml
secrets:
  - env: PACKAGES_VERSION
packages:
  - type: os-pm
    env:
      PACKAGES_VERSION: "%secret:PACKAGES_VERSION%"
    spec:
      - curl==8.12.1
```

A declared secret reaches `pm` only through such a reference: werf never picks up a secret because its id matches a variable name. A build that used to rely on a secret named `PACKAGES_VERSION` or `REGISTRY` being wired into `pm` on its own has to add the matching `env` entry — without it the packages stage fails on the missing version, and `pm` falls back to its own default registry.

Packages installed in a parent image are inherited by images based on it via `fromImage` and remain present in the child image SBOM.

### File-based package ecosystems

File-based types run the ecosystem's install command inside the build container and feed the resulting lock file to syft for SBOM generation. The package manager itself must be pre-installed in the builder image.

**Go modules** (`go-mod`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: go-mod
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `go mod download`. Default files: `go.mod` (spec) and `go.sum` (lock).

**Python — uv** (`python-uv`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: python-uv
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `uv sync --frozen`. Default files: `pyproject.toml` (spec) and `uv.lock` (lock).

**Python — pip** (`python-pip`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: python-pip
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `python3 -P -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`. Default spec: `requirements.txt`. No lock file (pip has no lock semantics; the `lock` field is rejected). `-P` keeps the workdir out of the module search path, so a project file named `pip.py` cannot replace the installer; it requires Python 3.11 or newer in the image — on an older interpreter, point `manager` at a pip executable instead.

**Python — poetry** (`python-poetry`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: python-poetry
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `poetry sync --no-root`. Default files: `pyproject.toml` (spec) and `poetry.lock` (lock).

**Rust — Cargo** (`rust-cargo`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: rust-cargo
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `cargo fetch`. Default files: `Cargo.toml` (spec) and `Cargo.lock` (lock). syft uses the `rust-cargo-lock-cataloger` to scan the lock file.

**Lua — LuaRocks** (`lua-rock`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: lua-rock
    workdir: /app
    spec: app-0.1-1.rockspec
```

Runs `luarocks install --only-deps <spec>`. Unlike the other ecosystems, `lua-rock` has no default spec: `spec` is required and must point to the `.rockspec` file (rockspec filenames follow the `<name>-<version>-<revision>.rockspec` convention). LuaRocks has no lock file, so the `lock` field is rejected. syft uses the `lua-rock-cataloger` to scan the rockspec.

**Ruby — Bundler** (`ruby-bundler`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: ruby-bundler
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `bundle install`. Default files: `Gemfile` (spec) and `Gemfile.lock` (lock). werf passes `BUNDLE_FROZEN=true`, so the lock must be committed and must match the `Gemfile` — otherwise the build fails instead of silently resolving a different set of gems. A lock written on a machine with another platform has to list the build platform as well (`bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux`). Set `env: {BUNDLE_FROZEN: "false"}` to opt out.

**Ruby — RubyGems** (`ruby-gemspec`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: ruby-gemspec
    workdir: /app
    spec: app.gemspec
```

Runs `gem build <spec>` followed by `gem install` of the built gem, which installs the gem itself together with its runtime dependencies; development dependencies are not installed. Like `lua-rock`, this type has no default spec: `spec` is required and must point to the `.gemspec` file. RubyGems has no lock file, so the `lock` field is rejected.

Both Ruby types take the licenses of the installed gems from the gemspecs RubyGems writes under the gem directory: `$BUNDLE_PATH` (for `ruby-bundler`), else `$GEM_HOME`, read from the image environment with `env` of the entry layered on top; an image that sets neither variable is read under `/usr/lib/ruby/gems`, where an interpreter built with the `/usr` prefix installs by default; an interpreter that installs elsewhere (a distribution package, for instance) needs `GEM_HOME` set in the image or in `env`. The gem directory is shared with the gems that ship with the interpreter, so only the gems the entry installed are read from it: for `ruby-bundler` the gems the lock pins, for `ruby-gemspec` the gem itself and its direct runtime dependencies — the dependencies of those are installed, but stay without a license in the SBOM. A bundler path configured in a `.bundle/config` file rather than the environment is not seen, and yields an SBOM without Ruby licenses. Gems installed from a `git:` or `path:` source are recorded from the lock, which carries no licenses for them; installing a gem from `git:` also requires `git` in the image.

**JavaScript — npm** (`javascript-npm`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: javascript-npm
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `npm ci`. Default files: `package.json` (spec) and `package-lock.json` (lock).

**JavaScript — Yarn** (`javascript-yarn`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: javascript-yarn
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`. Default files: `package.json` (spec) and `yarn.lock` (lock).

**JavaScript — pnpm** (`javascript-pnpm`):

```yaml
packages:
  - type: javascript-pnpm
    workdir: /app
```

Runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Default files: `package.json` (spec) and `pnpm-lock.yaml` (lock).

All file-based types support `workdir` (required), `spec` (optional, overrides default manifest filename), `lock` (optional, overrides default lock filename), and `manager` (optional, the package manager executable to run instead of the default one — a path inside the workdir of a preceding `packages` entry, so that the executable being run is the one pinned by that entry's lock file). All types, including `os-pm`, support an optional `env: {KEY: value}` field — the environment variables are added to the install command. Values are passed to the package manager as is: shell constructs such as `$(...)`, backticks and `$VARIABLE` are not evaluated. A value may reference a declared build secret, see [Secrets in packages](#secrets-in-packages). Multiple entries of the same or different types can be combined in one image:

```yaml
packages:
  - type: go-mod
    workdir: /app
  - type: rust-cargo
    workdir: /app/native
  - type: lua-rock
    workdir: /app/scripts
    spec: app-0.1-1.rockspec
  - type: ruby-bundler
    workdir: /app/tools
  - type: os-pm
    spec:
      - libssl-dev
```

### Secrets in packages

A `packages[].env` value can reference a secret declared in the `secrets` section:

- `%secret:<id>%` — the contents of the secret, without trailing newlines;
- `%secret_path:<id>%` — the path the secret is mounted at, `/run/secrets/<id>`.

A reference is resolved while the package manager runs, so the secret is never part of the build instructions or the stage digest. Whether it ends up in the resulting image is up to the package manager: `PACKAGES_VERSION` is written into the image and the SBOM by design, so do not put a value there that must not be readable from the image. Referencing a secret that is not declared fails the build during configuration parsing. Any other `%...%` sequence stays literal.

```yaml
secrets:
  - id: GOPROXY
    env: GOPROXY
  - id: CI_JOB_TOKEN
    env: CI_JOB_TOKEN
packages:
  - type: go-mod
    workdir: /app
    env:
      GOPROXY: "%secret:GOPROXY%"
      GOPRIVATE: git.example.com/*
      GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0: 'url.https://gitlab-ci-token:%secret:CI_JOB_TOKEN%@git.example.com/.insteadOf'
      GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0: 'https://git.example.com/'
      GIT_CONFIG_COUNT: "1"
```

For file-based types, declare the spec and lock files in `git.stageDependencies.packages` — otherwise changes to their contents will not rebuild the packages stage, leaving installed dependencies stale while the SBOM reports the updated files:

```yaml
git:
  - add: /
    to: /app
    stageDependencies:
      packages:
        - go.mod
        - go.sum
packages:
  - type: go-mod
    workdir: /app
```

The `os-pm` type does not need `stageDependencies`: its package list lives in `werf.yaml` itself, so any change to it rebuilds the stage automatically.

### Package managers absent from the builder image

When the builder image has no Yarn, pnpm, uv or Poetry, install the manager with an earlier `packages` entry and point the next entry at it with `manager`. The packages stage is the only stage with network access, so every step happens there — including installing npm itself with `os-pm`, when the builder image ships no Node.js either:

```yaml
git:
  - add: /
    to: /app
    excludePaths:
      - tools
    stageDependencies:
      packages:
        - package.json
        - yarn.lock
  - add: /tools
    to: /opt/tools
    stageDependencies:
      packages:
        - package.json
        - package-lock.json
packages:
  - type: os-pm
    spec:
      - node==24.18.0
  - type: javascript-npm
    workdir: /opt/tools
  - type: javascript-yarn
    workdir: /app
    manager: /opt/tools/node_modules/.bin/yarn
```

The entries run in the order they are declared: `pm` installs Node.js with npm, npm installs Yarn, Yarn installs the application dependencies. The npm entry needs no `manager` — `pm` puts npm onto `PATH`.

Here `/tools/package.json` declares Yarn itself as a dependency, and `/tools/package-lock.json` pins its version and integrity hash. The manager is installed like any other dependency: it appears in the image SBOM and stays in the built image. A `manager` pointing anywhere else — a bare executable name, a path from the builder image — is rejected: it would be resolved by the image instead of the configuration.

For Python the same recipe needs no `manager`: `pip` installs uv or Poetry onto `PATH`, and the following entry finds them there. Poetry additionally needs `POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE=false` in the builder image — otherwise it installs the dependencies into a virtualenv of its own instead of the image.

```yaml
packages:
  - type: python-pip
    workdir: /app
    spec: tools-requirements.txt
  - type: python-poetry
    workdir: /app
```

## Syntax

The top-level ***builder directive*** for assembly instructions is `shell`. You build an image via ***shell instructions***.

The _builder directive_ includes four directives that define assembly instructions for each _user stage_:

- `beforeInstall`;
- `install`;
- `beforeSetup`;
- `setup`.

Builder directives can also contain ***cacheVersion directives*** that, in essence, are user-defined parts of _user-stage digests_. The detailed information is available in the [CacheVersion](#dependency-on-the-cacheversion) section.

## Shell

Here is the example of the _user stage_ syntax featuring _shell assembly instructions_:

```yaml
shell:
  beforeInstall:
  - <bash_command 1>
  - <bash_command 2>
  # ...
  - <bash_command N>
  install:
  - bash command
  # ...
  beforeSetup:
  - bash command
  # ...
  setup:
  - bash command
  # ...
  cacheVersion: <version>
  beforeInstallCacheVersion: <version>
  installCacheVersion: <version>
  beforeSetupCacheVersion: <version>
  setupCacheVersion: <version>
```

_Shell assembly instructions_ are made up of arrays. Each array includes Bash commands for the corresponding _user stage_. Commands for each stage are executed as a single `RUN` instruction in Dockerfile. Thus, a single layer is created for each _user stage_.

werf provides distribution-agnostic Bash binary, so you do not need to add it to the [base image]({{ "usage/build/stapel/base.html" | true_relative_url }}).

```yaml
beforeInstall:
- apt-get update
- apt-get install -y build-essential g++ libcurl4
```

The `bash` binary is stored in a _Stapel volume_. You can find additional information about the concept in this [blog post [RU]](https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/352432/) (`dappdeps` has been renamed to `stapel`; still, the principle remains the same)

## Environment variables of the build container

You can use service environment variables which are available in build container during the build. They can be used in your shell assembly instructions. Using them will not affect the build instructions and will not trigger stage rebuilds, even if these service environment variables change.

The following environment variables are available:
- `WERF_COMMIT_HASH`. An example of value: `cda9d17265d174c62424e8f7b5e5640bf749c565`.
- `WERF_COMMIT_TIME_HUMAN`. An example of value: `2022-01-24 17:26:19 +0300 +0300`.
- `WERF_COMMIT_TIME_UNIX`. An example of value: `1643034379`.

Usage example:
{% raw %}
```yaml
shell:
  install:
  - echo "Commands on the Install stage for $WERF_COMMIT_HASH"
```
{% endraw %}

In the example above the current commit hash will be inserted into the `echo ...` command, but this will happen in the very last moment — when the build instructions will be interpreted and executed by the shell. This way there will be no "install" stage rebuilds on every commit.

## Using build secrets

> **NOTE:** To use secrets in builds, you need to enable them explicitly in the giterminism settings. Learn more ([here]({{ "/usage/project_configuration/giterminism.html#using-build-secrets" | true_relative_url }}))

A build secret is any confidential information, such as a password or API token, used during the build process of your application.

Build arguments and environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets during a build, as they may be retained in the final image.  
You can use secrets during the build process by defining them in `werf.yaml`.

```yaml
# werf.yaml
project: example
configVersion: 1
---
image: stapel-shell
from: ubuntu:22.04
secrets:
  - env: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - id: aws_secret_key
    env: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - src: "~/.aws/credentials"
  - id: plainSecret
    value: plainSecretValue
```

```yaml
# werf-giterminism.yaml
giterminismConfigVersion: 1

config:
  secrets:
    allowEnvVariables:
      - "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
      - "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    allowFiles:
      - "~/.aws/credentials"
    allowValueIds:
      - plainSecret
```

When using a secret in Stapel instructions, the secret is mounted to a file. The path for the secret file inside the build container is `/run/secrets/<id>`. If an `id` is not specified for a secret in `werf.yaml`, the default value is assigned automatically:

- For `env`, the `id` defaults to the name of the environment variable.
- For `src`, the `id` defaults to the file name (e.g., for `/path/to/file`, the `id` will be `file`). 

> For `value` — the `id` field is mandatory.

```yaml
# werf.yaml
project: example
configVersion: 1
---
image: stapel-shell
from: ubuntu:22.04
secrets:
  - env: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - id: aws_secret_key
    env: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - src: "~/.aws/credentials"
  - id: plainSecret
    value: plainSecretValue
shell:
  setup:
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(cat /run/secrets/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID) AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(cat /run/secrets/aws_secret_key) aws s3 cp ...
    - AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=$(cat /run/secrets/credentials) aws s3 cp ...
    - export WERF_BUILD_SECRET=$(cat /run/secrets/plainSecret)  
```

## User stage dependencies

werf features the ability to define the dependencies that will cause the _stage_ to be rebuilt. _Stages_ are built sequentially, and the _digest_ is calculated for each _stage_. _Digests_ have various dependencies. When those dependencies change, the _stage digest_ changes as well. As a result, werf rebuilds the affected _stage_ and all the subsequent _stages_.

You can use these dependencies to shape the rebuilding process of the _user stages_. The _digests_ of the _user stages_ (and, consequently, the rebuilding process) depend on:

- changes in the assembly instructions;
- changes of the _cacheVersion directives_;
- changes in the Git repository;
- changes in the files imported from the [images]({{ "usage/build/stapel/imports.html" | true_relative_url }}).

The first three dependency types are described in more detail below.

## Dependency on changes in the assembly instructions

The _digest_ of the user stage depends on the rendered text of the assembly instructions. Changes in the assembly instructions for the _user stage_ lead to the rebuilding of this _stage_. Suppose you have the following _shell-based assembly instructions_:

```yaml
shell:
  beforeInstall:
  - echo "Commands on the Before Install stage"
  install:
  - echo "Commands on the Install stage"
  beforeSetup:
  - echo "Commands on the Before Setup stage"
  setup:
  - echo "Commands on the Setup stage"
```

During the first build of this image, instructions for all four user stages will be executed. There is no _git mapping_ in this _config_, so the assembly instructions will never be executed on subsequent builds, since _digests_ of user stages will be the same, and the build cache will remain valid.

Let us change the assembly instructions for the _install_ user stage:

```yaml
shell:
  beforeInstall:
  - echo "Commands on the Before Install stage"
  install:
  - echo "Commands on the Install stage"
  - echo "Installing ..."
  beforeSetup:
  - echo "Commands on the Before Setup stage"
  setup:
  - echo "Commands on the Setup stage"
```

The digest of the install stage has changed, so running `werf build` will result in executing the assembly instructions in the _install_ stage as well as the instructions defined in subsequent _stages_, i.e., _beforeSetup_ and _setup_.

The stage digest may also change due to the use of environment variables and Go templates, resulting in unforeseen rebuilds:

{% raw %}
```yaml
shell:
  beforeInstall:
  - echo "Commands on the Before Install stage for {{ env "CI_COMMIT_SHA” }}"
  install:
  - echo "Commands on the Install stage"
  # ...
```
{% endraw %}

In the example above, the _digest_ of the _beforeInstall_ stage will be calculated during the first build:

```shell
echo "Commands on the Before Install stage for 0a8463e2ed7e7f1aa015f55a8e8730752206311b"
```

The _digest_ of the _beforeInstall_ stage will change with each subsequent commit:

```shell
echo "Commands on the Before Install stage for 36e907f8b6a639bd99b4ea812dae7a290e84df27"
```

In other words, the contents of the assembly instructions will change with each subsequent commit because of the `CI_COMMIT_SHA` variable. So this configuration causes the _beforeInstall_ user stage to be rebuilt at each commit.

## Dependency on changes in the Git repo

</a>

The _git mapping reference_ states that there are _gitArchive_ and _gitLatestPatch_ stages. _gitArchive_ runs after the _beforeInstall_ user stage, and _gitLatestPatch_ runs after the _setup_ user stage if there are changes in the local Git repository. Thus, in order to run the assembly instructions on the latest source code version, you can initiate the rebuilding of the _beforeInstall_ stage (by changing _cacheVersion_ or its instructions).

The _install_, _beforeSetup_, and _setup_ user stages also depend on changes in the Git repository. In this case, a git patch is applied at the beginning of the _user stage_, and the assembly instructions are executed on the latest version of the source code.

> During the process of building an image, the source code is updated **only at one of the stages**; all subsequent stages are based on this stage and thus use the actualized files. The source files contained in the Git repository are added during the first build at the _gitArchive_ stage. All subsequent builds update the source files at _gitCache_, _gitLatestPatch_ stages, or at one of the following user stages: _install_, _beforeSetup_, _setup_.

![git files actualized on specific stage]({{ "images/build/git_mapping_updated_on_stage.png" | true_relative_url }})

The `git.stageDependencies` parameter specifies exactly which file changes trigger a rebuild of the user stages. It has the following syntax:

```yaml
git:
- ...
  stageDependencies:
    install:
    - <mask 1>
    # ...
    - <mask N>
    beforeSetup:
    - <mask>
    # ...
    setup:
    - <mask>
```

The `git.stageDependencies` parameter has 3 keys: `install`, `beforeSetup`, and `setup`. Each key defines an array of masks for a single user stage. The _user stage_ will be rebuilt if there are changes in the Git repository that match one of the masks defined for the _user stage_.

For each _user stage_, werf creates a list of matching files and calculates a checksum based on the attributes and contents of each file. This checksum is a part of the _stage digest_. Thus, the digest changes in response to any changes in the repository, such as getting new file attributes, changing file contents, adding or deleting a new matching file, etc.

The `git.stageDependencies` masks work jointly with the `git.includePaths` and `git.excludePaths` filters: both of them constrain the set of files a mask can match. A file is a dependency of a _user stage_ if it matches one of the `stageDependencies` masks of that stage, matches the `includePaths` filter (when it is set), and does not match the `excludePaths` filter. Exclusion only subtracts files: `excludePaths` never adds a file to a _user stage_.

The `stageDependencies` masks work in the same fashion as the `includePaths` and `excludePaths` filters. The mask defines a file and path template and may contain the following glob patterns:

- `*` — matches any file. This pattern includes `.` and excludes `/`;
- `**` — matches directories recursively or files expansively;
- `?` — matches any single character. It is equivalent to /.{1}/ in regexp;
- `[set]` — matches any character within the set. It behaves exactly like character sets in regexp, including set negation ([^a-z]);
- `\` — escapes the next metacharacter.

A mask starting with `*` is treated as an anchor name by the YAML parser. Thus, masks starting with `*` or `**` patterns at the beginning must be surrounded by quotation marks:

```yaml
# * at the beginning of mask, so use double quotation marks
- "*.rb"
# single quotation marks also work
- '**/*'
# no star at the beginning, no quotation marks are needed
- src/**/*.js
```

werf finds out whether the files have been changed in the Git repository by calculating checksums. It applies the following algorithm to the _user stage_ and to each mask:

- create a list of all files in the `add` path and apply the `excludePaths` and `includePaths` filters;
- compare the path of each file in the list to the mask using the glob patterns;
- if some directory matches a mask, then all the contents of that directory are considered to be matching recursively;
- calculate checksums of attributes and contents of all matching files.

These checksums are calculated at the beginning of the build process before any stage container is run.

Example:

```yaml
image: app
git:
- add: /src
  to: /app
  stageDependencies:
    beforeSetup:
    - "*"
shell:
  install:
  - echo "install stage"
  beforeSetup:
  - echo "beforeSetup stage"
  setup:
  - echo "setup stage"
```

The _git mapping configuration_ in the above `werf.yaml` instructs werf to transfer the contents of the `/src` directory of the local Git repository to the `/app` directory of the image. During the first build, files will be cached at the _gitArchive_ stage, and assembly instructions for _install_, _beforeSetup_ and _setup_ will be executed. During the builds triggered by the subsequent commits which leave the contents of the `/src` directory unchanged, werf will not run the assembly instructions. Changes in the `/src` directory due to some commit will also result in changes in the checksums of the files matching the mask. This will cause werf to apply the git patch and rebuild any existing stages starting with _beforeSetup_, namely _beforeSetup_ and _setup_. The git patch will be applied once during the _beforeSetup_ stage.

### Masks of the stages that are not set

werf derives the masks of the stages that are not set from the stages that are set. The stages are always ordered by the build order — _install_ → _beforeSetup_ → _setup_ — regardless of the order of the keys in `werf.yaml`, and the derivation is performed separately for each _git mapping_:

- a stage with explicitly set masks uses exactly those masks;
- an explicitly set empty list (`[]`) means no direct dependency on the files of the Git repository, and it still counts as declaring the stage;
- a stage that is not set **before** the last explicitly declared stage gets `[]`;
- a stage that is not set **after** the last explicitly declared stage gets `**/*`;
- if `stageDependencies` is omitted entirely or set to `{}`, all three stages get `**/*`.

The resulting masks for the typical configurations are the following:

| `stageDependencies` in `werf.yaml` | _install_ | _beforeSetup_ | _setup_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| omitted, or `stageDependencies: {}` | `**/*` | `**/*` | `**/*` |
| `beforeSetup: ["src/**/*"]` | `[]` | `src/**/*` | `**/*` |
| `install: ["package.json", "package-lock.json"]` and `setup: ["src/**/*"]` | `package.json`, `package-lock.json` | `[]` | `src/**/*` |
| `install: ["package-lock.json"]` | `package-lock.json` | `**/*` | `**/*` |
| `beforeSetup: []` | `[]` | `[]` | `**/*` |
| `setup: []` | `[]` | `[]` | `[]` |

For example, with all other build inputs unchanged, in the configuration below the _install_ stage is rebuilt only when `package-lock.json` changes, while _beforeSetup_ and _setup_, which follow the last declared stage, are rebuilt on any change of the added source code:

```yaml
image: app
from: alpine:3.20
git:
- add: /
  to: /app
  stageDependencies:
    install:
    - package-lock.json
shell:
  install: ["echo install"]
  beforeSetup: ["echo beforeSetup"]
  setup: ["echo setup"]
```

Declare all three stages to leave nothing to the derived masks:

```yaml
image: app
from: alpine:3.20
git:
- add: /
  to: /app
  stageDependencies:
    install:
    - package-lock.json
    beforeSetup: []
    setup:
    - "src/**/*"
shell:
  install: ["echo install"]
  beforeSetup: ["echo beforeSetup"]
  setup: ["echo setup"]
```

An empty list disables only the direct dependency of the stage on the files of the Git repository. The dependency on the previous stages, on the base image, on the assembly instructions and on the other inputs is not affected: when an earlier stage is rebuilt, the subsequent ones are rebuilt as well.

The masks do not create stages: a _user stage_ without assembly instructions is not created regardless of its masks, and a non-empty set of masks for a stage without assembly instructions remains a configuration error. The _beforeInstall_ stage has no key in `stageDependencies` and never depends on the files of the Git repository directly.

## Dependency on the CacheVersion

There are situations when a user wants to rebuild all _user stages_ or just one of them. They can do so by changing `cacheVersion` or `<user stage name>CacheVersion` parameters.

The digest of the _install_ user stage depends on the value of the `installCacheVersion` parameter. To rebuild the _install_ user stage (and
subsequent stages), you have to change the value of the `installCacheVersion` parameter.

> Note that the `cacheVersion` and `beforeInstallCacheVersion` directives have the same effect. Changing them will cause the _beforeInstall_ stage and all subsequent stages to be rebuilt.

### Example: A universal image for multiple applications

An image containing shared system packages can be defined in a separate `werf.yaml` file. You can use the `cacheVersion` parameter for rebuilding this image to update the package versions.

```yaml
image: app
from: ubuntu:latest
shell:
  beforeInstallCacheVersion: 2
  beforeInstall:
  - apt update
  - apt install ...
```

This image can be used as a base for multiple applications if images from _hub.docker.com_ do not suit your needs.

### Example of using external dependencies

You can use _CacheVersion directives_ jointly with the Go templates to define dependencies of a _user stage_ on files outside the Git tree.

{% raw %}
```yaml
image: app
from: ubuntu:latest
shell:
  installCacheVersion: {{.Files.Get "some-library-latest.tar.gz" | sha256sum}}
  install:
  - tar zxf some-library-latest.tar.gz
  - <build application>
```
{% endraw %}

The build script can be used to download the `some-library-latest.tar.gz` archive and then run the `werf build` command. Any changes to the file will trigger the rebuild of the _install user stage_ and all the subsequent stages.

## Using the SSH agent

By default, werf mounts the SSH agent socket into all build containers, allowing your instructions to use the SSH agent for authentication. This is especially useful for commands that require SSH access, such as cloning private repositories.

You can find detailed information about using the SSH agent in werf [here]({{ "/usage/build/process.html#using-the-ssh-agent" | true_relative_url }}).
