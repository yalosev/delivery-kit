---

SBOM scanning and artifact generation is **enabled** with the `build.sbom.enable` setting and, optionally, **configured** globally (the `build.sbom` section) or per image (for example, `image.sbom.gost`).

The split of SBOM work between roles (module developer and product SBOM owner) and the step-by-step workflows are described on the [SBOM roles and workflow]({{ "/usage/build/sbom_workflow.html" | true_relative_url }}) page.

The scanning result is saved as an OCI artifact in the container registry, attached to the corresponding image. **The `--repo` flag is required** when SBOM generation is enabled. If `--repo` is not specified, the build fails with:

```
SBOM generation requires a container registry (specify --repo)
```

## Technical limitations

- Only the **Docker backend** is supported.
- Only the **Stapel syntax** for describing images (`werf.yaml`) is supported.
- **Network is disabled in shell stages**: downloading dependencies with a command in any shell stage (`beforeInstall`, `install`, `beforeSetup`, `setup`) will not work — dependencies are installed declaratively via the [`packages` directive]({{ "/usage/build/stapel/instructions.html#installing-binary-packages" | true_relative_url }}) only. This is what guarantees that all dependencies are recorded in the SBOM.
- The SBOM is built from **controlled inputs**: every `packages` entry is handled by its own cataloger (for file-based types syft reads the manifest/lock file — `go.sum`, `package-lock.json`, and so on; for `os-pm` — a dedicated cataloger). The list of supported ecosystems is fixed.
- **Vendored dependencies are not recorded**: dependencies committed to the repository directly (`vendor/`, `third_party/`, and so on) bypass `packages` and do not end up in the SBOM. Do not use vendoring — all dependencies must come in via `packages`.
- An SBOM exists only for images built with `build.sbom.enable: true` — previously built images have no SBOM and must be rebuilt.

## Global project configuration (`build.sbom`)

The following options enable the scanning process for all images in the project:
1. Set `build.sbom.enable: true` to activate the feature.
2. Specify the output standard via `standard: cyclonedx@1.6` (currently only `cyclonedx@1.6` is supported).

```yaml
project: werf-sbom-meta-example
configVersion: 1
build:
  sbom:
    enable: true
    standard: cyclonedx@1.6
```

Currently, this option uses the following _defaults_:

| Property                          | Value                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scanner**                       | syft                                                                                   |
| **Scanner Image**                 | anchore/syft:v1.45.1                                                           |
| **Image Pull Policy**             | `PullIfMissing`                                                                        |
| **Data Source Connection Method** | Directory scan of the spec/lock files extracted from the built image, without the Docker socket           |
| **Path in Source Image**          | The declared `packages` spec/lock files                                                |
| **Scan Settings**                 | [link](https://github.com/anchore/syft/wiki/Configuration#list-of-configurable-values) |
| **Output Standard**               | `CycloneDX@1.6`                                                                        |
| **Output Format**                 | `JSON`                                                                                 |

For stapel images with file-based `packages`, each declared spec file (for example `go.mod` or `requirements.txt`) is read from the built image and scanned directly as a directory source, without mounting the Docker socket. A declared lock file (for example `go.sum`) is included when present but is optional — a module with no dependencies has none, and its absence is tolerated with a warning, since without the lock transitive dependencies may be missing from the SBOM. If a required spec file is not present as a regular file in the built image — for example removed by a later stage, or present only as a symlink — the build fails with an error naming the directive and the missing path.

## Base image requirements

When SBOM generation is enabled, every base image referenced via `from` or `fromImage` and every image referenced via `import` **must have an SBOM artifact attached in the registry**. There is no alternative to this requirement; the only exception is described below.

If an image has no attached SBOM, the build fails and reports that the base image must have an SBOM artifact attached.

Rebuild the base image with `build.sbom.enable: true` to resolve this.

If the base image is `scratch`, it produces an empty SBOM with no components.

### Legacy exception (deprecated)

Two families of older Deckhouse builder images have no attached SBOM:

- `registry.deckhouse.io/container-factory/builder/golang` (and its tags)
- `registry.deckhouse.io/container-factory/builder/alpine` (and its tags)

Builds using these images still succeed today, but emit a deprecation warning:

```
The builder image "..." is DEPRECATED and it WILL CAUSE AN ERROR in the future.
Plan your migration to an up-to-date builder image.
```

Any other Deckhouse builder image that has no SBOM — including newer `container-factory` builder images — will fail with:

```
the base image "..." must have an SBOM artifact attached;
the image is a builder image but SBOM is required
```

Rebuild such images with `build.sbom.enable: true` to attach an SBOM.

## How the SBOM is stored

The SBOM is stored as an OCI artifact whose subject is the manifest of the target image. This makes it discoverable by any tool that understands the OCI referrers relationship.

### Artifact structure

The CycloneDX document is wrapped in an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) statement and then in a [DSSE](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse) envelope before being stored. The layer carrying the envelope has the media type `application/vnd.dsse.envelope.v1+json`; the in-toto predicate type is `https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.6`.

### Registry compatibility

werf always uses a tag-based index to store and retrieve SBOM artifacts, regardless of whether the registry supports the OCI referrers API. No registry-specific configuration is required. Additionally, werf sets the OCI `subject` field on the artifact manifest, which allows external tools that understand the OCI referrers specification to discover and access the SBOM directly. Both access paths are maintained automatically on every push.

### Artifact annotations

Each SBOM artifact carries the following annotations on its descriptor in the index:

| Annotation | Contents |
|---|---|
| `io.werf.image-name` | Name of the image this SBOM belongs to |
| `io.werf.checksum` | Content checksum of the image |
| `io.werf.target-platform` | Target CPU/OS platform (e.g. `linux/amd64`) |

### Multi-platform images

When building a multi-platform image, werf generates a separate SBOM artifact for each platform. Each platform SBOM is annotated with its `io.werf.target-platform` value so that tooling can retrieve the correct one.

## GOST security properties (`sbom.gost`)

To comply with GOST safety standards, you can configure mandatory security properties for all components in the SBOM. These properties will be injected into the whole component tree of the final SBOM. By default, both generated and user-defined SBOMs are enriched with `attackSurface=yes` and `securityFunction=yes`, unless specified otherwise at the project (meta) or image level.

1. `attackSurface`: The attack surface property (`yes` | `no` | `indirect`).
2. `securityFunction`: The security function property (`yes` | `no`).

`attackSurface: yes` lands on the packages the image declares and is recorded as `indirect` on everything those packages pull in. The declared packages are the ones named by the spec file of every `packages` directive of the image: the direct `require` entries of `go.mod` (without the `// indirect` marker), every dependency table of `package.json` (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, `peerDependencies`), every dependency table of `Cargo.toml` (`[dependencies]`, `[dev-dependencies]`, `[build-dependencies]` and the same under `[target.*]`), every requirement list of `pyproject.toml` (`[project].dependencies`, `[project.optional-dependencies]`, `[dependency-groups]`, `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`, `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]`, `[tool.poetry.group.*.dependencies]`), every entry of `requirements.txt`, the rock a rockspec describes, every `gem` entry of a `Gemfile`, the gem a gemspec describes together with its runtime dependencies, and the `spec` entries of an `os-pm` directive. Development and build dependencies count because the install command of the directive puts them into the image. A declaration matches a component by name; a version takes part only when the declaration pins one exactly. When the SBOM carries several versions of a declared package, the copies no other package depends on are taken — the top-level one, not a copy nested under another package — and when every copy is nested, all of them. A spec file werf cannot read costs the declaration only, with a warning: the image is then split as if it declared nothing. They are recorded in the SBOM as a `dependsOn` edge from the image component (`metadata.component`), and werf records itself in `metadata.tools`. They are inherited: an image declares everything its base image and its imported images declare, so an image assembled from artifacts without a `packages` directive of its own is still split along the declarations of those artifacts. Only the SBOM werf produced is read this way — a root edge in the SBOM another tool attached to a base image means something else (Trivy lists there everything the image contains) and is not inherited. A `dependencies` graph between the packages themselves is recorded alongside wherever the ecosystem provides one; for `go-mod` it is read from `go mod graph` run offline inside the built image, which must therefore keep the Go toolchain and module cache, and for a target platform other than the host's needs binfmt emulation on the build host; when the run fails or exceeds five minutes, a warning is logged and the SBOM carries no edges between the modules.

The split is per image: once the image declares anything, every component it does not declare — a package installed by a `shell` instruction or by a Dockerfile, a package of a base image whose SBOM was built by an older werf — is `indirect`. An SBOM without such an edge — one built by an older werf, or imported from outside — falls back to the dependency tree: `yes` lands on the components nothing else depends on, and when no tree is recorded at all, on every component. `no` and `indirect`, and `securityFunction` in all cases, apply unchanged to the whole tree.

You can define these globally in `build.sbom.gost` or per-image in `image.sbom.gost`. Image-level configuration overrides global configuration.

> **NOTE:** GOST properties integration is experimental and strictly tied to the `cyclonedx@1.6` standard.

Example:
```yaml
build:
  sbom:
    enable: true
    standard: cyclonedx@1.6
    gost:
      attackSurface: yes
      securityFunction: no
```

### Source languages (`GOST:source_langs`)

The `GOST:source_langs` property is filled in automatically and needs no configuration: every component cataloged through a `packages` directive gets the source language of that directive's ecosystem (`go-mod` — `Go`, `python-pip`/`python-poetry`/`python-uv` — `Python`, `rust-cargo` — `Rust`, `javascript-npm`/`javascript-yarn`/`javascript-pnpm` — `JavaScript`, `lua-rock` — `Lua`, `ruby-bundler`/`ruby-gemspec` — `Ruby`).

Packages installed by `os-pm` are prebuilt binaries, so their languages cannot be derived from the directive: they carry the languages declared for the package in the pm catalogue (the `srcLanguages` field), and packages without that declaration carry no property. Recording this field in the installed-package index requires pm v0.1.7 or newer and a catalogue that declares `srcLanguages`. Updating only the pm binary does not populate existing index entries: rebuild the image with packages freshly installed using a compatible pm and catalogue. Until then, os-pm components whose installed entries lack the field have no `GOST:source_langs` property.

When SBOMs are merged with `werf sbom merge`, the languages of all images are collected on the product component, and in the `container` format the languages of an image's components are additionally collected on that image's container component.

## VCS external references enrichment

When SBOM is enabled, werf enriches components with VCS external references at build time via an external purl resolution service. The service URL is set with the `WERF_EXTERNAL_REFS_SERVER_URL` environment variable (there is no CLI flag):

```bash
export WERF_EXTERNAL_REFS_SERVER_URL="https://purl-resolver.example.com/"
```

With `build.sbom.enable: true`, the variable is **required** — without it the build fails with:

```
WERF_EXTERNAL_REFS_SERVER_URL env var is required
```

When SBOM is disabled, the variable is not used.

## SBOM signing

SBOM signing is an optional build step. It is enabled by passing a signing key to `werf build`:

| Flag | Environment variable | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--sign-key` | `WERF_SIGN_KEY` | the private key: a path to a PEM file, a base64-encoded PEM, or `hashivault://[KEY]` |
| `--sign-cert` | `WERF_SIGN_CERT` | the leaf certificate: a path to a PEM file or a base64-encoded PEM |
| `--sign-intermediates` | `WERF_SIGN_INTERMEDIATES` | the intermediate certificates: a path to a PEM file or a base64-encoded PEM |

If `--sign-key` is not provided, the SBOM is generated and published unsigned — this is not an error.

The `werf sbom get`, `werf sbom merge`, and `werf sbom validate` commands accept no signing flags: `get` downloads the artifact as is, while `merge` and `validate` operate on already downloaded SBOMs. To verify the signature of an SBOM artifact, use `werf attest verify` with a public key (`--key`).

## Caching and rebuilds

Toggling `build.sbom.enable` changes the stage digest, so enabling or disabling SBOM generation invalidates the cache and triggers a full rebuild.

While SBOM generation is off (the default), stage digests are identical to those of a project that has never used this feature. Caches built before SBOM support was introduced remain valid and continue to be reused. If you enable the feature and later turn it off again, digests return to their original values.

Changing GOST properties (`sbom.gost`) does not affect stage digests. Cached stages are reused, and the SBOM document is regenerated with the updated properties during the SBOM step.

## Inspecting and merging SBOMs

[`werf sbom get`]({{ "/reference/cli/werf_sbom_get.html" | true_relative_url }}) retrieves the SBOM for an image described in `werf.yaml` and prints it to stdout. The SBOM is read as an OCI artifact from the container registry, so `--repo` is required. When invoked with an image name, the command runs the standard werf build conveyor: missing stages and SBOM artifacts are created, just like with `werf build` (with the `--require-built-images` flag the command fails instead). You can select a specific version with `--tag` or `--digest` (mutually exclusive) — in this mode the command only downloads the ready-made SBOM and fails if it is not found.

[`werf sbom merge`]({{ "/reference/cli/werf_sbom_merge.html" | true_relative_url }}) assembles a product-level SBOM from several per-image SBOMs. It takes a JSON file that maps image names to sha256 digests, pulls the individual SBOMs from the registry, and merges them into a single CycloneDX document with dependency graphs preserved. Two ISPRAS output formats are available: `container` (hierarchical, each image becomes a top-level component with nested packages) and `oss` (flat, all packages deduplicated into one list). GOST properties are aggregated bottom-up: `attack_surface` with the precedence `yes > indirect > no`, `security_function` with `yes > no`. An image SBOM carrying a GOST value outside these domains — `security_function: indirect` written by an older werf, for instance — is rejected; rebuild the image first.

[`werf sbom validate`]({{ "/reference/cli/werf_sbom_validate.html" | true_relative_url }}) checks a CycloneDX JSON file against ISPRAS schemas. It runs sbom-checker inside a Docker container and reports any violations, split into errors and warnings, with both counts shown in the summary. By default any error or warning fails the validation; pass `--warnings-non-fatal` to keep warnings informational (printed on stderr) so that only errors set a non-zero exit code. Both `oss` and `container` SBOM types are supported.
